# Unravelings for initially correlated system and environment
Stochastic unravelings for open systems initially correlated with their environment by using the one-sided positive decomposition for the dynamics.

Examples include dephasing ($d=2$ and $d=4$) Jaynes-Cummings model (both single mode and continuum) and two interacting qubits plus an external bath.

Unravelings are done using either MCWF, QSD or $\Psi$-RO.
